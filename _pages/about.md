I am a Senior Data Scientist at [Zurich Insurance](https://www.zurich.com/).
Before that, I was a Postdoc at [UKP Lab](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/ukp_home/index.en.jsp) at TU Darmstadt and a
PhD student at the [Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence](http://www.bosch-ai.com) and the [Institute for Natural Language Processing](https://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/en/) at the [University of Stuttgart](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/en/) before.

## Research Interests
I work at the intersection of AI (in particular NLP) and human-computer interaction (HCI).  
Currently, my work focuses on how humans interact with AI systems (in particular large language models) and how AI's "behaviour" can be explained to humans and evaluated in a meaningful and responsible way.
