I'm a Postdoc at [UKP Lab](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/ukp_home/index.en.jsp) at TU Darmstadt and was a
PhD student at the [Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence](http://www.bosch-ai.com) and the [Institute for Natural Language Processing](https://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/en/) at the [University of Stuttgart](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/en/) before.

## Research Interests
I work on the intersection of natural language processing (NLP) and human-computer interaction (HCI).  
Currently, my work focuses on how the behavior of AI systems (e.g., large language models) can be explained to human
users and how AI systems can be meaningfully evaluated.
